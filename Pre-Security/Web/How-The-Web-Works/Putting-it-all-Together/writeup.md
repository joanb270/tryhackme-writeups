## 📌 Overview
This room connects DNS, HTTP, and website architecture into a full web request lifecycle.

## 🧠 Full Flow
1. DNS resolves domain to IP
2. Browser sends HTTP request
3. Web server processes request
4. Backend generates response
5. Browser renders content

## 🔐 Security Perspective
- Attacks can happen at any stage
- Defense must be layered
- Visibility is key for detection

## 🧠 SOC Relevance
- Incident tracing
- Log correlation
- Attack path analysis

## ✅ Key Takeaways
- Web security is interconnected
- Weakness in one layer breaks everything
- Understanding flow improves detection & response
