# How The Web Works – Module Writeup

## 📌 Overview
This module explains how the modern web functions under the hood. Understanding these concepts is critical for both offensive and defensive security, as most real-world attacks target web technologies.

The module covers:
- DNS resolution
- HTTP communication
- Website architecture (frontend & backend)
- How all components interact together

## 🎯 Why This Matters in Cybersecurity
Most cyber attacks today target web applications:
- Account Takeovers
- SQL Injection
- XSS
- Session Hijacking
- Sensitive Data Exposure

Without understanding how the web works, exploiting or defending it correctly is impossible.

## 🔐 Security Mindset
> Never trust the frontend.  
> Always validate on the backend.  
> Everything exposed is attack surface.

## ✅ Key Skills Gained
- Understanding DNS request flow
- Reading and analyzing HTTP requests/responses
- Identifying weak web architecture
- Recognizing common web attack vectors
