## 🎯 Learning Objectives

The main objectives of this module were to:

- Understand what cybersecurity is and why it matters
- Learn the difference between **offensive** and **defensive** security
- Become familiar with common defensive security domains
- Explore different career paths in cybersecurity
- Build a foundational security mindset

---

## 🔴 Offensive Security Overview

### What is Offensive Security?

Offensive security focuses on **finding and exploiting vulnerabilities** before malicious attackers do. It simulates real-world attacks in a **legal and controlled environment**.

### Key characteristics

- Think like an attacker
- Identify weaknesses in systems, networks, and applications
- Exploit vulnerabilities to demonstrate impact
- Report findings so they can be fixed

### Common Offensive Roles

- Penetration Tester
- Ethical Hacker
- Red Team Operator

### Why Offensive Security Matters

Understanding how attacks work helps organizations improve defenses and reduce risk.

---

## 🔵 Defensive Security Overview

### What is Defensive Security?

Defensive security focuses on **protecting systems, detecting attacks, and responding to incidents**.

Instead of breaking in, defenders focus on **monitoring, analysis, and response**.

### Core Defensive Domains Introduced

- **SOC (Security Operations Center)**
- **DFIR (Digital Forensics & Incident Response)**
- **Threat Intelligence**
- **Malware Analysis**
- **SIEM Monitoring**

### Typical Defensive Tasks

- Monitoring alerts
- Analyzing logs
- Investigating suspicious activity
- Responding to incidents
- Improving detection rules

---

## 🧠 SOC (Security Operations Center)

### What a SOC Does

A SOC is responsible for continuously monitoring an organization’s environment to detect, analyze, and respond to security incidents.

### SOC Analyst Responsibilities

- Review alerts from security tools
- Analyze logs and events
- Identify Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)
- Escalate or contain incidents
- Document findings clearly

### Why SOC is Important

The SOC is often the **first line of defense** against cyber attacks.

---

## 🧪 DFIR (Digital Forensics & Incident Response)

### Digital Forensics

- Collecting and analyzing evidence after an incident
- Preserving data integrity
- Understanding what happened and how

### Incident Response

- Detecting incidents
- Containing threats
- Eradicating malicious activity
- Recovering systems

---

## 🧬 Threat Intelligence

### What is Threat Intelligence?

Threat Intelligence involves collecting and analyzing data about threats to help organizations anticipate and prevent attacks.

Examples include:
- Malicious IP addresses
- Known attacker techniques
- Malware indicators

---

## 💼 Careers in Cybersecurity

### Common Career Paths Introduced

- SOC Analyst
- Incident Responder
- Penetration Tester
- Threat Intelligence Analyst
- Malware Analyst

### Entry-Level Focus

The module emphasizes SOC Analyst as a strong entry point due to:
- High demand
- Exposure to real incidents
- Broad learning opportunities

---

## 🧠 Security Mindset Developed

This module reinforced key security principles:

- Attackers and defenders think differently
- Security is not only technical, but procedural
- Monitoring and visibility are critical
- Documentation is as important as detection

---

## 🏁 Conclusion

The *Introduction to Cyber Security* module provides a clear overview of the cybersecurity field, highlighting the difference between offensive and defensive roles and helping learners identify potential career paths.

This module serves as a foundation for further technical learning in areas such as Linux, networking, SOC operations, and incident response.
