# OSI Model – Writeup

## 📌 Overview
The OSI model explains how data moves through a network in seven layers.

## 🧠 OSI Layers
1. Physical
2. Data Link
3. Network
4. Transport
5. Session
6. Presentation
7. Application

## 🔐 Security Perspective (SOC)
- Attacks map to OSI layers (e.g. DDoS at Layer 4)
- Helps categorize alerts and incidents
- Essential for troubleshooting

## 🧠 Real-World Analogy
OSI is like sending a package:
- Packing, labeling, shipping, delivery, opening

## ✅ Key Takeaways
- Conceptual model, not a protocol
- Helps understand where attacks occur
- Critical for SOC analysis
