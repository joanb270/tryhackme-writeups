# Intro to LAN – Writeup

## 📌 Overview
A Local Area Network (LAN) connects devices within a limited area such as a home, office, or building.

## 🧠 Key Concepts
- Switches connect devices inside a LAN
- Routers connect LANs to other networks
- Private IP addresses are used internally

## 🔐 Security Perspective (SOC)
- LAN attacks include ARP spoofing and lateral movement
- Internal networks are often trusted incorrectly
- Segmentation reduces attack impact

## 🧠 Real-World Analogy
A LAN is like an office building:
- Rooms = devices
- Hallways = network cables
- Reception = router

## ✅ Key Takeaways
- LANs are private networks
- Internal traffic can still be malicious
- Defense-in-depth applies internally
