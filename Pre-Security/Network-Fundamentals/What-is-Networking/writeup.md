# What is Networking? – Writeup

## 📌 Overview
Networking is the foundation of how computers communicate with each other. It enables data exchange between devices using agreed rules called protocols.

## 🧠 Key Concepts
- A network connects two or more devices
- Devices communicate using IP addresses
- Data is sent following defined protocols (TCP/IP)

## 🔐 Security Perspective (SOC)
- Every network connection is a potential attack surface
- Misconfigured networks allow unauthorized access
- Monitoring traffic is critical for detecting threats

## 🧠 Real-World Analogy
A network is like a postal system:
- IP address = home address
- Protocols = postal rules
- Data packets = letters

## ✅ Key Takeaways
- Networking enables communication
- Protocols define how data moves
- Security starts at the network level
