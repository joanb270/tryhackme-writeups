# Packets & Frames – Writeup

## 📌 Overview
Data is broken into packets and frames to travel efficiently across networks.

## 🧠 Key Concepts
- Frames operate at Layer 2 (MAC addresses)
- Packets operate at Layer 3 (IP addresses)
- Fragmentation allows large data transfers

## 🔐 Security Perspective (SOC)
- Packet inspection reveals malicious traffic
- IDS/IPS analyze packets
- Packet manipulation enables attacks

## 🧠 Real-World Analogy
Like breaking a book into pages and mailing them separately.

## ✅ Key Takeaways
- Data is never sent whole
- Each layer adds its own information
- Inspection is key for detection
